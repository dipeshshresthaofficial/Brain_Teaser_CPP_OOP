# Brain_Teaser_CPP_OOP

This is my 4th Sem Academic Project on Object Oriented Programming with C++ language.

Brain Teaser is structured as a game where in at a time two player can compete. Its a dual player game.

Brain Teaser main objective is to spread non-bookish knowledge to the students and engaging them with the gaming background. This helps them in acquaring both knowledge as well as entertain themself. All the questions are based on General Knowledge.
It includes various OOPs concepts like:

1> Inheritance
2> Polymorphism
3> Abstraction and Encapsulation
4> Friend Function


It provides a non-GUI gaming environment where the player has to guess the riddle analyzing the hint provided. Itâ€™s more focused on refining the brain with non-bookish knowledge.
